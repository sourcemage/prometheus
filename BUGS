just so we are clear here is a list of bugs i already know about:

prometheus can not handle sorcery bugs well, this means that if sorcery
hangs for whatever reason, which it does, if you run it for days on end
like have been, prometheus is helpless to stop it.

If bugzilla goes down addbug breaks miserably and gives up, someday I
will make prometheus handle this more gracefully

pm-update doesnt do cvs, but seeing as how we still mostly use p4...
i think thats okay for now.

if you ctrl-c out of prometheus somewhere the lock file sticks around
and prometheus sees it later when you reload it. For some reason i
have been unsuccessful at making it check for the existance of another
pm-test process.

Some would say this md5sum image stuff is a bug because it takes so
long. However in other files I have clearly stated my opinion on this.
Besides it works really well.
